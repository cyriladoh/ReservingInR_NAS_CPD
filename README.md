You are viewing the Readme.md file for this repository located along with the underlying source code on Github, written in R, using Shiny. This repository was created for learning purposes only and should only be used for that.

I have excluded the data used during the CPD session due to data privacy issues that may arise. I shall formally request from the data owner if I can make the data public.
